The pattern full description
</a>

The API Gateway pattern is also sometimes known as the "backend for frontend" (BFF) because you build it while thinking about the needs of the client app.
So,  It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to the appropriate backend service and then returning the serviceâ€™s response back to the client.
